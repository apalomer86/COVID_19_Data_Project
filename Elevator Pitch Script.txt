There was a popular meme around the pandemic saying that we were *not* all in the same boat. Even within the United States, it's obvious to see that the US mainland had a bigger boat to work with than the US territories.

Join us as we look at John Hopkins data from the first three years of the pandemic to see how the rates of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 differed between the US mainland and the US territories.

You'll see that despite having smaller boat with less people might have actually benefitted some of the US territories since there was less room for the virus to spread. Some of them even fared better than the mainland.

You'll also see that the territories with active US military bases weren't as lucky in this regard. The boats for Guam and Puerto Rico were smaller than the ship  that that was the US mainland, but Guam sadly had an even higher rate of deaths due to COVID-19 than the mainland did.

Regardless of the boat we're on, everyone matters. America is more than just the 50 states. Hopefully, unpacking this data can help us all be better prepared for the next global crisis.
